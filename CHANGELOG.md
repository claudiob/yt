supported by YouTube API as of [April 15, 2020](https://developers.google.com/youtube/analytics/revision_history#october-15,-2019).

Use `by: :day` option instead and add up the numbers from each day.

If you keep using `by: :week` option after this change it will raise an error
(before the gem upgrade) or it will run with `day` dimension instead (after
the gem upgrade, like any other random input).

## 0.31.2 - 2017-06-29

## 0.31.0 - 2017-06-02

**How to upgrade**

If your code calls `.uniques` it should be removed because this metric has been
no longer supported by YouTube API as of [October 31, 2016](https://developers.google.com/youtube/analytics/revision_history#september-27-2016).

* [IMPROVEMENT] Retry 3 times if YouTube responds with 503 Backend Error

## 0.30.0 - 2017-03-17

**How to upgrade**

If your code uses `Yt::Models::Configuration` then you must use
`Yt::Configuration` instead.

Both `Yt::Configuration` and `Yt::Config` have been moved in a separate
gem called `yt-support` that is required by default by the `yt` gem.

* [REMOVAL] Remove `Yt::Models::Configuration` (renamed as `Yt::Configuration`)

* [FEATURE] Add `Video#length` to show the duration as an ISO 8601 time.

## 0.29.0 - 2017-02-17

**How to upgrade**

If your code uses `Yt::URL` then you must include the `yt-url` gem, since
`Yt::URL` has been extracted into a separate repository.
Please read the documentation of `Yt::URL` and notice that the `subscription`
pattern has been dropped, so URLs such as the following will not be recognized
anymore: `subscription_center?add_user=...`, `subscribe_widget?p=...`.

Note that this also removes the option of initializing a resource by URL.
You can achieve the same result with the `yt-url` gem, as detailed in its
documentation.

Finally note that this also remove the class `Yt::Description`. This class
was private API, so this change should not affect developers.

* [REMOVAL] Remove the option to initialize resources by URL.
* [REMOVAL] Remove `Yt::Resource.username`
* [REMOVAL] Remove `Yt::URL` (extracted into separate gem)
* [REMOVAL] Remove `Yt::Description` (now simply a String).

## 0.28.0 - 2016-10-18

**How to upgrade**

If your code calls `.earnings` and `.impressions`
then you must replace that code  with `.estimated_revenue` and
`.ad_impressions` since those metrics will no longer be supported by
YouTube API as of [November 4, 2016](https://developers.google.com/youtube/analytics/revision_history#august-10-2016).

* [REMOVAL] Remove `#earnings` method for channels, playlists, videos and video groups
* [REMOVAL] Remove `#impressions` method for channels, videos and video groups
* [FEATURE] Add `#estimated_revenue` method for channels, videos and video groups

## 0.27.0 - 2016-10-07

**How to upgrade**

If your code calls any of the following `..._on` method to fetch metrics on
a specific day, you need to replace it with the equivalent method that does
not end with `_on`. For instance replace `views_on(3.days.ago)` with the
equivalent `views(since: 3.days.ago, until: 3.days.ago)`.

## 0.25.28 - 2016-04-05

* [BUGFIX] If no asset ID is set, calling ContentOwner#assets will now use the path, /youtube/partner/v1/assetSearch, instead of '/youtube/partner/v1/assets'

## 0.25.0 - 2015-06-29

**How to upgrade**

If your code expects 10 videos when calling a report `by: :video` or
`by: :related_video`, beware that those reports now return 25 videos.
If you only need the first 10, just add `.first(10)` to your result.
For instance: `channel.views(by: :video).first(10).to_h`.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Return 25 results on reports by video / related video.
* [FEATURE] New `playback_based_cpm` report for channels and videos.

## 0.24.10 - 2015-06-25

* [BUGFIX] Don't raise error when YouTube returns a deleted video while eager loading

## 0.24.0 - 2015-05-21

**How to upgrade**

If your code expects the `estimated_minutes_watched`
or the `average_view_duration` report to return a `Float`, beware that they now
return an `Integer` (since that is what YouTube returns).
In case you still need to parse a float, just append `.to_f` to the result.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Return Integer on `estimated_minutes_watched` reports
* [ENHANCEMENT] Return Integer on `average_view_duration` reports
* [FEATURE] New `by: :referrer` option for reports.

## 0.23.2 - 2015-05-20

* [FEATURE] Accept `:includes` in reports by video, related video and playlist to preload parts.

## 0.23.1 - 2015-05-19

* [FEATURE] New `by: :month` option for reports.
* [FEATURE] New `.reports` method to fetch multiple metrics at once.

## 0.23.0 - 2015-05-18

**How to upgrade**

If your code expects reports to return results **by day** then you **must** add
the `by: :day` option to your report method. The new default is `by: :range`.
For instance `channel.views` would return

    {Wed, 8 May 2014 => 12.4, Thu, 9 May 2014 => 3.2, Fri, 10 May 2014 => …}

and now returns the same as calling `channel.views by: :range`:

    {total: 3450}

Additionally, if you expect reports **by day** then you **must** specify the
`:since` option to your report method. Previously, this value was set to
`5.days.ago`, but now is required. `:until` still defaults to `Date.today`.

Finally, if you expect reports for the entire range, notice that the default
 `:since` option is now set to the date when YouTube opened. Therefore calling a
method like `channel.views` now returns the **lifetime** views of a channel.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Change default from `by: :day` to `by: :range`.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Require `:since` options for any report by day.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Change default range for reports by range to lifetime.

## 0.22.2 - 2015-05-15

* [FEATURE] New `by: :search_term` option for reports.
* [FEATURE] New `in: {state: 'XX'}` option to limit reports to a US state
* [FEATURE] New `uniques by: :day` report

## 0.22.1 - 2015-05-13

* [FEATURE] New `by: :country` option for channel, video and playlist reports
* [FEATURE] New `by: :state` option for channel, video and playlist reports
* [FEATURE] New `:in` option to limit reports to a country

## 0.22.0 - 2015-04-30

**How to upgrade**

If your code expects any of the following method to return Float values, then
be aware that they now return Integer. You can still call `to_f` if you do need
a Float: views, `comments`, `likes`, `dislikes`, `shares`, `subscribers_gained`,
`subscribers_lost`, `favorites_added`, `favorites_removed`, `annotations`,
`impressions`, `monetized_playbacks`, `playlist_starts`.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Return `Integer` values for reports that can never return decimal digits.
* [FEATURE] New `by: :range` option for reports, to return a metric without dimensions (that is, for the whole range)

## 0.21.0 - 2015-04-30

**How to upgrade**

If your code doesn’t use `PolicyRule#ACTIONS`, then you are good to go.
If it does, then you should redefine the constant in your own app.

* [REMOVAL] Remove `PolicyRule#ACTIONS` (was `%q(block monetize takedown track)`).
* [BUGFIX] Make `account.playlists` and `account.channel.playlists` behave the same.

## 0.20.0 - 2015-04-29

**How to upgrade**

If your code doesn’t use any of the following constants that were public but
undocumented, then you are good to go.

If it does, then you should redefine those constants in your own app, since
it’s not Yt’s goal to validate the values posted to YouTube API.

* [REMOVAL] Remove `Asset#STATUSES` (was `%q(active inactive pending)`).
* [REMOVAL] Remove `Claim#STATUSES` (was `%q(active appealed disputed inactive pending potential takedown unknown)`).
* [REMOVAL] Remove `Claim#CONTENT_TYPES` (was `%q(audio video audiovisual)`).
* [REMOVAL] Remove `Reference#STATUSES` (was `%q(activating active checking computing_fingerprint deleted duplicate_on_hold inactive live_streaming_processing urgent_reference_processing)`).

* [REMOVAL] Remove `Status#PRIVACY_STATUSES` (was `%q(private public unlisted)`).

## 0.19.0 - 2015-04-28

**How to upgrade**

If your code never calls `partnered_channels.includes(:viewer_percentages)` on
a Yt::ContentOwner, then you are good to go.

If it does, then be aware that viewer percentage is not eager-loaded anymore,
so the call above is equivalent to `partenered_channels`. The reason is that
viewer percentage *requires* a time-range, and using a default range of the
last 3 months can generate more confusion than added value.

Also if your code still uses the deprecated:

- `.viewer_percentages` method, replace with `.viewer_percentage`.
- `policy.time_updated` method, replace with `policy.updated_at`.
- `video.uploaded?` method, replace with `video.uploading?`.

* [REMOVAL] Remove `.includes(:viewer_percentages)` on `content_owner.partnered_channels`.
* [REMOVAL] Remove deprecated `viewer_percentages` (use `viewer_percentage` instead)
* [REMOVAL] Remove deprecated `policy.time_updated` (use `updated_at` instead)
* [REMOVAL] Remove deprecated `video.uploaded?` (use `uploading?` instead)

## 0.18.0 - 2015-04-28

**How to upgrade**

If your code never calls `public?`, `private?` or `unlisted?` on a Status
object, then you are good to go.

If it does, then call the same methods on the parent Resource object instead.
For instance, replace `video.status.private?` with `video.private?`.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Don’t over-delegate privacy status methods of Resource.

## 0.17.0 - 2015-04-28

**How to upgrade**

If your code never calls video-specific methods on `video.status`, then you are
good to go.

If it does, then call the same methods on `video`, rather than `video.status`.
For instance, replace `video.status.deleted?` with `video.deleted?`.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Don’t over-delegate methods of Video.
* [ENHANCEMENT] Complete documentation of Yt::Video.

## 0.16.0 - 2015-04-27

**How to upgrade**

If your code never calls `video.uploaded?`, then you are good to go.

If it does, then replace your calls with `video.uploading?`.
In fact, the YouTube constant `uploaded` identifies the status where a
video is **being uploaded**.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Rename `uploaded?` to `uploading?` to avoid confusion.

## 0.15.3 - 2015-04-27

* [FEATURE] New `file_size`, `file_type`, `container` methods for Yt::Video.

* [FEATURE] New `annotation click-through rate` report for videos and channels.
* [FEATURE] New `annotation close rate` report for videos and channels.

## 0.15.0 - 2015-04-19

**How to upgrade**

If your code never calls the `viewer_percentage(gender: [:female|:male])` method
on a Channel or Video object, then you are good to go.

If it does, then replace your calls to `viewer_percentage(gender: :female)`
with `viewer_percentage(by: gender)[:female]`, and do the same for `:male`.

Note that the _plural_ `viewer_percentages` method still works but it’s
deprecated: you should use `viewer_percentage` instead.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Remove `:gender` option in `viewer_percentage` in favor of a more generic `:by`
* [FEATURE] New `by: :gender` option for reports, to return viewer percentage by gender
* [FEATURE] New `by: :age_group` option for reports, to return viewer percentage by age group
* [ENHANCEMENT] The viewer percentage report now accepts start/end date options (like any other report)
* [DEPRECATION] Deprecate `viewer_percentages` in favor of `viewer_percentage`.

* [BUGFIX] Make list videos by id work for exactly 50 ids.

## 0.13.0 - 2014-09-11

**How to upgrade**

If your code never calls the `create_playlist` on a Channel object, then you
are good to go.

If it does, then replace your calls to `channel.create_playlist` with
`account.create_playlist`, that is, call `create_playlist` on the channel’s
account instead.

* [ENHANCEMENT] Remove `create_playlist` from Channel (still exists on Account)
* [ENHANCEMENT] Accept `category_id` in `upload_video`.

## 0.12.2 - 2014-09-09

* [FEATURE] Add `update` to PlaylistItem (to change the position of the item in the playlist)

## 0.12.0 - 2014-08-31

**How to upgrade**

If your code never calls the `delete` method directly on a Subscription
object (to delete subscriptions by id), then you are good to go.

If it does, then be aware that trying to delete an unknown subscription will
now raise a RequestError, and will not accept `ignore_errors` as an option:

    account = Yt::Account.new access_token: 'ya29...'
    subscription = Yt::Subscription.new id: '--unknown-id--', auth: account
    # old behavior
    subscription.delete ignore_errors: true # => false
    # new behavior
    subscription.delete # => raises Yt::Errors::RequestError "subscriptionNotFound"

Note that the `unsubscribe` and `unsubscribe!` methods of `Channel` have not
changed, so you can still try to unsubscribe from a channel and not raise an
error by using the `unsubscribe` method:

    account = Yt::Account.new access_token: 'ya29...'
    channel = Yt::Channel.new id: 'UC-CHANNEL-ID', auth: account
    channel.unsubscribe # => returns falsey if you were not subscribed
    channel.unsubscribe! # => raises Yt::Errors::RequestError if you were not subscribed

* [ENHANCEMENT] Replace `has_many :subscriptions` with `has_one :subscription` in Channel
* [FEATURE] Add `subscribed_channels` to Channel (list which channels the channel is subscribed to)
* [FEATURE] Add `subscribers` to Account (list which channels are subscribed to an account)

## 0.11.6 - 2014-08-28

* [BUGFIX] Make Resource.new(url: url).title hit the right endpoint

## 0.11.5 - 2014-08-27

## 0.11.1 - 2014-08-17

* [ENHANCEMENT] Add Video search even without a parent account or channel

For instance, to search for the most viewed video on the whole YouTube, run:

    videos = Yt::Collections::Videos.new
    videos.where(order: 'viewCount').first.title #=>  "PSY - GANGNAM STYLE"

## 0.11.0 - 2014-08-17

**How to upgrade**

When a request to YouTube fails, Yt used to print out a verbose error message,
including the response body and the request that caused the error (in curl
format). This output could include sensitive data (such as the authentication
token). For security reasons, Yt will not print it out anymore by default.

If this is acceptable, then you are good to go.
If you want the old behavior, set the `log_level` of Yt to `:debug`:

    Yt.configure do |config|
      config.log_level = :debug
    end

* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `log_level` to Yt.configuration

## 0.10.5 - 2014-08-17

* [BUGFIX] Make Yt work on Ruby 1.9.3 / ActiveSupport 3.0 again (was broken by 0.10.0)

## 0.10.0 - 2014-08-11

**How to upgrade**

If your code never calls the `size` method to count how many items a list of
results has (e.g., how many videos an account has), then you are good to go.

If it does, then be aware that `size` will now return try to the number of
items as specified in the "totalResults" field of the first page of the YouTube
response, rather than loading *all* the pages (possibly thousands) and counting
exactly how many items are returned.

If this is acceptable, then you are good to go.
If you want the old behavior, replace `size` with `count`:

    account = Yt::Account.new access_token: 'ya29...'
    # old behavior
    account.videos.size # => retrieved *all* the pages of the account’s videos
    # new behavior
    account.videos.size # => retrieves only the first page, returning the totalResults counter
    account.videos.count # => retrieves *all* the pages of the account’s videos

* [ENHANCEMENT] Calling `size` on a collection does not load all the pages of the collection
* [ENHANCEMENT] Alias `policy.time_updated` to more coherent `policy.updated_at`

## 0.9.8 - 2014-08-11

* [FEATURE] Add `.content_owner` and `.linked_at` to channels managed by a CMS content owner

## 0.9.7 - 2014-08-02

## 0.9.6 - 2014-08-02

* [ENHANCEMENT] Accept angle brackets characters in videos’ and playlists’ metadata

## 0.9.5 - 2014-08-02

* [FEATURE] Allow status attributes of a video to be updated

`video.update` now accepts three new attributes: `privacy_status`,
`public_stats_viewable` and `publish_at`.

## 0.9.4 - 2014-08-02

* [FEATURE] Expose metadata for live-streaming videos

New method are now available for `Video` instance to check their live-streaming
details: `actual_start_time`, `actual_end_time`, `scheduled_start_time`,
`scheduled_end_time` and `concurrent_viewers`.

## 0.9.3 - 2014-07-30

* [BUGFIX] Don’t cache `.where` conditions on multiple calls

For instance, invoking `account.videos.where(q: 'x').count` followed by
`account.videos.count` used to return the same result, because the `where`
conditions of the first request were wrongly kept for the successive request.

* [FEATURE] Check if a ContentID claim is third-party with `claim.third_party?`
* [ENHANCEMENT] `update` methods accept both underscore and camel-case attributes

For instance, either of the following syntaxes can now be used:
`video.update categoryId: "22"` or `video.update category_id: "22"`.

## 0.9.2 - 2014-07-29

* [FEATURE] List ContentID policies with `content_owner.policies`

## 0.9.1 - 2014-07-28

* [FEATURE] List ContentID references with `content_owner.references`
* [ENHANCEMENT] `playlist.update` accepts both `privacyStatus` and `privacy_status`

For instance, either of the following syntaxes can now be used:
`playlist.update privacyStatus: "unlisted"` or
`playlist.update privacy_status: "unlisted"`.

## 0.9.0 - 2014-07-28

**How to upgrade**

If your code never declares instances of `Yt::Rating`, or never calls the
`update` method on them, then you are good to go.

If it does, then *simply replace `update` with `set`*:

    rating = Yt::Rating.new
    # old syntax
    rating.update :like
    # new syntax
    rating.set :like

* [ENHANCEMENT] `rating.set` replaces `rating.update` to rate a video

## 0.8.5 - 2014-07-28

* [FEATURE] Delete a video with `video.delete`

## 0.8.4 - 2014-07-24

* [BUGFIX] Correctly parse annotations with timestamp written as `t='0'`

## 0.8.3 - 2014-07-24

* [FEATURE] Include all the video-related status information in `video.status`

New method are now available for `Video` instance to check their status
information: `public?`, `uploaded?`, `rejected?`, `failed?`, `processed?`,
`deleted?`, `uses_unsupported_codec?`, `has_failed_conversion?`, `empty?`,
`invalid?`, `too_small?`, `aborted?`, `claimed?`, `infringes_copyright?`,
`duplicate?`, `inappropriate?`, `too_long?`, `belongs_to_closed_account?`,
`infringes_trademark?`, `violates_terms_of_use?`, `has_public_stats_viewable?`,
`belongs_to_suspended_account?`, `scheduled?`, `scheduled_at`, `embeddable?`
`licensed_as_creative_commons?` and `licensed_as_standard_youtube?`.

## 0.8.0 - 2014-07-19

**How to upgrade**

If your code never declares instances of `Yt::Channel`, or never calls the
`subscribe` method on them, then you are good to go.

If it does, then be aware that `subscribe` will not raise an error anymore if
a YouTube user tries to subscribe to her/his own YouTube channel. Instead,
`subscribe` will simply return `nil`.

If this is acceptable, then you are good to go.
If you want the old behavior, replace `subscribe` with `subscribe!`:

    account = Yt::Account.new access_token: 'ya29...'
    channel = account.channel
    # old behavior
    channel.subscribe # => raised an error
    # new behavior
    channel.subscribe # => nil
    channel.subscribe! # => raises an error
